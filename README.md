# House Price Prediction System
## Description
This web application predicts house prices based on user inputs. It uses three machine learning algorithms—Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor—combined in a stacking model to provide accurate predictions. Users can input details such as average area income, house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and population to get an estimated house price.
